**Abstract:** Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease (HD) mice has recently been reported using microbiome profiling in 
R6/1 HD mice and replicated in clinical HD. In HD mice, environmental enrichment(EE) and exercise (EX) have previously demonstrated a therapeutic
impacts on the brain, and associated symptoms. We hypothesize that these housing interventions modulate the gut microbiome, configuring one of 
the mechanisms that mediate their potential effects observed in HD. We exposed R6/1 mice to a protocol of either EE or EX, relative to standard-housed (SH) 
control conditions, before the onset of gut dysbiosis and motor deficits, characterizing gut functioning and gut microbiome profiling 
using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our multivariate analysis identified the orders Bacteroidales, Lachnospirales and Oscillospirales as the main bacterial 
signatures that discriminate the housing conditions. Our findings suggest a promising role for the gut microbiome in mediating the effects of 
extended EE and EX exposure in HD mice.
